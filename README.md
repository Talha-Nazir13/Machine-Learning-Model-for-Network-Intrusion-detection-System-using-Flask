# Network-Intrusion-detection-model-in-Heroku-using-FLASK.
##Problem Statement
Intrusion detection software is essential to protect a computer network from outsiders and those working within the system. This effort aims to develop a network intrusion detector, a prediction model that can spot malicious intrusions and attacks while ignoring legitimate connections. Assume that this is a BINARY classification issue. Wrong links can be found using the following models (intrusions).
